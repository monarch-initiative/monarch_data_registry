# Monarch Data Registry

This is a repository to coordinate the metadata and dissemination of all Monarch-produced data resources across teams and organisations. A data resource is a file that is available for download and re-use, ususally subject to versioning. This repository should not actually contain any data, only references to it. Discussions should be restricted to the following topics:

1. Persistent resolvable identifiers across Monarch
1. Registering new Monarch data in the metadata registry
1. Minimal metadata model for all Monarch data products
1. Harmonisation of metadata values (attribution, provenance, versioning) across Monarch data products
