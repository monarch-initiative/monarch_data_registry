# Monarch Data Registry

This is a repository to coordinate the metadata and dissemination of all Monarch-produced data sources across teams and organisations. It does not actually contain any data. Discussions should be restricted to the following topics:

1. Persistent resolvable identifiers across Monarch
1. Registering new Monarch data in the metadata registry
1. Harmonisation of metadata (attribution, provenance, versioning) across Monarch data products
